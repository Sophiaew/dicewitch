            Dungeons & Dragons is populated by various species, from humans and
            halflings to tiefling and genasi. Your choice of your character's
            race will have a fundamental effect on who they are. This chapter
            shall provide information on additional playable races and the
            racial traits that accompany them.

      <h2>Elf Subraces</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the elves commonly found across the multiverse, there are some
        subraces that are much less known. These additional elf subrace options
        include the high flying Avariel and the arctic hunter Snow Elves.
      </p>
      <h3>Avariel</h3>
      <p>
        Avariel, also known as winged or sky elves, are a rare sight to be seen,
        but when they are seen, they embody grace. Avariels soar through the sky
        on wings. They have a long drawn history of conflict with dragons, which
        has led to their rarity as a race.
      </p>
      <h4>Avariel Traits</h4>
      <p>
        Avariel have the following traits in common, in addition to the traits
        they share with other elves. <br />
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by
        1. <br />
        <strong>Flight.</strong> You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this
        speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. <br />
        <strong>Sharp Eyes.</strong>Whenever you make an Intelligence
        (Investigation) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to
        the total ability check.<br />
        <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read and write Auran.
      </p>
      <h3>Snow Elves</h3>
      <p>
        Snow elves as a group have found their home in the arctic. Over time
        they have evolved to adapt to the harsh cold and thrive in it. Other
        elves may see snow elves as savages or barbaric in nature, as they are
        fierce hunters and care little for the modernity of the world beyond
        them.
      </p>
      <h4>Snow Elf Traits</h4>
      <p>
        Snow elves have the following traits in common, in addition to the
        traits they share with other elves.<br />

        increases by 1.<br />

        <strong>Child of the Snow.</strong> You have resistance to cold damage.
        When you reach 5th level, you can cast the protection from energy spell
        once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a
        long rest. When you use this feature to cast protection from energy, it
        can only be used to give a creature resistance to cold damage.<br />
        <strong>Snow Elf Training.</strong> You have proficiency with the spear,
        shortbow, longbow and net.<br />
        <strong>Tracker's Sense.</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom
        (Survival) checks you make to find or track a creature.
      </p>
      <h2>Dwarf Variant</h2>
      <h3>Arctic Dwarves</h3>
      <p>
        Arctic dwarves much like all other dwarves are very hard workers, but
        they do their work in the harshest of conditions. Laying claim upon the
        land of icy tundras, arctic dwarves have made their civilization. Across
        years, these dwarves have changed to their environment, becoming
        smaller, stronger and smarter. Though their stature is small, they are a
        proud people and are able to back up their pride.
      </p>
      <h4>Arctic Dwarf Traits</h4>
      <p>
        If your dwarf character is an arctic dwarf, the following traits replace
        all racial traits found in the Player’s Handbook, except for Age,
        Alignment, Speed, Darkvision, and Languages.

        <strong>Forged in the Cold.</strong> Though small, arctic dwarves are
        mighty fighters. You gain proficiency with one heavy weapon of your
        choice and while wielding this type of weapon you do not suffer the
        negative effects of wielding a heavy weapon while being a small
        creature.<br />
        <strong>Frigid Artisan.</strong> You gain proficiency with two artisan’s
        tools of your choice.<br />
