      <p>
        When you are creating your character you have the option of choosing
        between the many fantastical races including those listed above, but
        that is not your only option. You also have the option of choosing a
        character lineage. If you choose a lineage, you might have once been a
        member of another race, but you arenâ€™t any longer. This chapter outlines
        two new lineage options: Contract Bound and Underdark Survivor.
        <br />When you create a character and choose a lineage in place of a
        race, use the following rules laid out in
        <em>Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft.</em>
      </p>
      <h2>Ability Score Increases</h2>
      <p>
        When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores
        by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three
        different scores by 1. You follow this rule regardless of the method you
        use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.<br />
        If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score
        Increase you previously had with these.
      </p>
      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language
        that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.<br />
        If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any languages
        you had and gain no new languages.
      </p>
      <h2>Contract Bound</h2>
      <p>
        With the signing of an infernal contract, a contract bound is reborn
        into their new form. Contract bound are individuals who seeked audience
        with powerful devils or perhaps in the face of a devil's wrath struck a
        deal. The signing away of one's soul in place for power and hellish
        abilities.
      </p>
      <h3>Contract Bound Origins</h3>
      <p>
        Contract Bound are the results of encounters with devils, sometimes
        willing, but more often not. The nature of the deal struck with this
        fiend has altered the life of your character. The Contract Bound Origins
        table provides suggestions for how your character gained their lineage.

        You have the following racial traits.<br />
        <strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Fiend. Size. You are Medium or
        Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.<br />
        <strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
        <strong> Legacy.</strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you
        can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies
        you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you
        gained from it. If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose
        this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills
        of your choice.<br />
        <strong>Sight of the Devils.</strong> You gain darkvision out to a range
        of 60 feet. As an action, you can see normally in darkness, both magical
        and nonmagical up to the range of your darkvision for 1 minute. Once you
        use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.<br />
        Devil's Hide. You have resistance to either fire damage or poison damage
        (choose when you gain this lineage).<br />
        <strong>Soul Collector.</strong> The souls of those you slay in combat
        grant you benefit. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points,
        you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier
        (minimum of one). Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until
        you finish a short or long rest.<br />
        <strong>Devil's Tongue.</strong> Whenever you make a Charisma
        (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can roll a d4 and add
        the number rolled to the total ability check. You can speak, read and
        write Infernal.
